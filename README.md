# Product Vision

Your vision statement should contain the following information and be formatted as one or more paragraphs. This statement must be included in your main README file and not linked externally. 

1. For ... (the productâ€™s target market)
2. Who/That ... (describe what need your product solves)
3. The product ... (product name,or product category)
4. That leads to ... (main advantage, appealing reason for purchase)
5. Unlike the ... (principal competing alternatives)
6. Our product offers ... (describe main differentiation)

As a general note, it is much easier (and less risky) to use inline markdown text for any text documents you create. If you choose to use Google Docs or Google Sheets, you run the risk of providing an invalid link or linking to a file that is not properly shared. If myself or the grader cannot access your artifact, you will not receive credit for it - even if you fix the problem after it has been graded.
