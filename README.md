As a general note, it is much easier (and less risky) to use inline markdown text for any text documents you create. If you choose to use Google Docs or Google Sheets, you run the risk of providing an invalid link or linking to a file that is not properly shared. If myself or the grader cannot access your artifact, you will not receive credit for it - even if you fix the problem after it has been graded.
